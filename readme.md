# JS-Billiards (name pending)

Until I come up with a better name, JS-Billiards is a browser implementation of pool written in Javascript. JS-Billiards includes the standard 8-ball and 9-ball variations of pool, but will also include a couple of fun game modes: Pool with Powers and Chaos Pool. 

<b>Pool with Powers</b> will randomly assign you a <i>power</i> that you can use at any time. These include:
- Teleport Ball: the first ball that the cue ball comes into contact with will be removed and placed at a random location on the table. The cue ball will continue moving as if the ball was never there. 
- Blunt Tip: on your opponent's next shot, their spin will be completely random. 
- Free Scratch: you are allowed a scratch on this turn. But if the cue ball ends up in a pocket, your opponent gets ball in hand anyway. 
- And many more! 

<b>Chaos Pool</b> will only allow you to select direction. Power and spin will be randomized.
